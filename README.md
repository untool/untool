`untool` is a JavaScript tool designed to streamline configuration and usage of other JavaScript tools. By default, it comes with a basic development and runtime environment for universal React applications. This environment is highly modular. Every one of its default modules is configurable and extensible - and entirely optional.

## Why?

JavaScript tooling is amazing nowadays. There are tons of bundlers, transpilers, analyzers, optimizers, minifiers, formatters, linters, build-, command- and test-runners, package managers... and then, of course, there are gazillions of frameworks, libraries, modules, components, extensions, plugins, addons, mixins...

Everything is just a `yarn add` (or `npm install`) away, available free of charge, all built, maintained and supported by enthusiast, diverse communities of voluteers. Things are truly looking peachy.

The sheer amount of tools has a couple of downsides, though. One of them is the fact that it has become increasingly tedious to wire up all these tools, to get and keep them working together.

Having to do so over and over again, probably for many different projects, can be a bit annoying - and frankly quite expensive. `untool` is being developed to alleviate this annoyance, to help make even complex tooling setups portable and shareable.

## How?

`untool` aims to be a tool for toolsmiths, enabling us to configure, combine and compose other tools. We try to keep it as minimal, extensible and un-opinionated as possible.

`untool` consists of a small [core](https://github.com/untool/untool/tree/master/packages/core) and some basic mixins providing build, development and production runtimes.

`untool`'s core is based on [`mixinable`](https://github.com/untool/mixinable), a highly flexible, declarative microframework providing a rather advanced mixin architecture. In `mixinable` parlance, `untool` mixins can define both application strategies and implementations.

This extensible core is built with a very powerful configuration engine with full support for presets and multiple environments. Its config can, of course, trivially be extended to support your own mixins and even your whole application. Your application can, in turn, be used as a preset in other apps.

## What?

Out of the box, `untool` leverages the likes of [Yargs](http://yargs.js.org), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and [Express](https://expressjs.com). Its default app runtime implementation is based on [React](https://reactjs.org).

The default mixins expose hooks to completely alter their behaviour and functionality. Tap into them using your own mixins and reconfigure Webpack, register additional Express middlewares and Yargs commands or fetch data to bootstrap your React application.

Of course, you can also use `untool` to add custom mixins, in turn exposing their own hooks. There are three distinct types of mixins you can add: core, server, and browser. Core mixins are used for building and running your app, while the others are runtime mixins that are being used inside your actual application.

The [`@untool/react`](https://github.com/untool/untool/tree/master/packages/react) package comes with all three kinds of mixins. Why not use it as a starting point for your own mixins?

## What Next?

### Installation

As `untool` is completely modular, there is no single best way to install its different parts. Installing its global [command line interface](https://github.com/untool/untool/blob/master/packages/cli/README.md) (CLI), however, is a sensible way to get started.

```bash
$ yarn global add untool # OR npm install --global untool
```

Having installed this global CLI package, you can set up your first `untool` project. The easiest way to do so is to install the `@untool/defaults` package and its dependencies.

```text
$ mkdir foo && cd $_
$ yarn init -y
$ yarn add @untool/defaults react react-dom react-helmet react-router react-router-dom
```

Finish the basic setup by adding a new `untool` section to your `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "untool": {
    "presets": ["@untool/defaults"]
  }
}
```

Now, start building your app. `untool` will pick up whatever is configured as your project's main entry point. The following lines will give you a minimal React app.

```text
$ cat << EOT > index.js
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'untool';
export default render(<h1>meep</h1>);
EOT
```

After these steps, you are good to go: you can just run your app by executing the command `un start` inside your project folder.

### Utilization

To use `untool`, you certainly do not have to learn about all the parts and concepts it is build upon. A big part of what it aims to do is to allow toolsmiths and app builders to work independently of each other.

If you need to extend its features, you will want to take a peek into the black box, though. To become acquainted with `untool`'s innards, it certainly makes sense to dive into its README files. This is the recommended reading order:

- [`@untool/core`](https://github.com/untool/untool/blob/master/packages/core/README.md): central base module all other packages rely upon
- [`@untool/defaults`](https://github.com/untool/untool/blob/master/packages/defaults/README.md): default preset incorporating all other main packages
- [`@untool/yargs`](https://github.com/untool/untool/blob/master/packages/yargs/README.md): project-local command line interface
- [`@untool/express`](https://github.com/untool/untool/blob/master/packages/express/README.md): development and production server implementation
- [`@untool/webpack`](https://github.com/untool/untool/blob/master/packages/webpack/README.md): webpack setup (including Babel)
- [`@untool/react`](https://github.com/untool/untool/blob/master/packages/react/README.md): universal React implementation

At some point, though, you will have to read our source files: if, for example, merely configuring [`@untool/webpack`](https://github.com/untool/untool/blob/master/packages/webpack/README.md) and using its existing hooks does not suffice for your requirements, you will probably want extend it.
