`untool` is a JavaScript tool designed to streamline configuration and usage of other JavaScript tools. By default, it comes with a basic development and runtime environment for universal React applications. This environment is highly modular. Every one of its default modules is configurable and extensible - and entirely optional.

## Contribution

### Setup

We are using [git](https://git-scm.com), [lerna](https://lernajs.io) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for building `untool`. To be able to help us out effectively, you have to have `git` and `yarn` globally available on your machine.

If you want to contribute to `untool`, create a [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/about-forks/) of its [repository](https://github.com/untool/untool/fork) using the GitHub UI and clone your fork into your local workspace:

```text
$ mkdir untool && cd $_
$ git clone git@github.com:<USER>/untool.git .
$ yarn install
```

### Adding a new feature or fixing a bug

When you are finished implementing your contribution, go ahead and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). If you are planning to add a feature, please open an [issue](https://github.com/untool/untool/issues/new) first and discuss your plans.

All code in this repository is expected to be formatted using [prettier](https://prettier.io), and we will only merge valid [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) in order to enable automatic [versioning](https://semver.org).

We will not usually accept pull requests introducing breaking changes unless we are preparing a `major` release: `untool` strives to be a solid and robust base for others to build upon.

### Releasing a new version

Releasing untool requires the environment variable `GH_TOKEN` [to be set](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/version#--github-release) to a valid [GitHub access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with the `public_repo` scope in order to publish the release notes to the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/untool/untool/releases).

### Branching in untool

We are using the `master` branch as our **staging branch** and we have a maximum of two active **release branches** at a time. The release branches follow the naming convention of `vN.x` (where `N` is the major version number of that release).

All PRs (except for PRs generated by renovate or release PRs) must be made against `master` and include in their description, and through a label, for which release they are intended.

We have appointed branch maintainers for each of the release branches, who will take care of cherry-picking the required changes.

During preparation of a new release the branch maintainer for that release will cherry-pick the required commits from master into a PR targeting the release branch.

If conflicts arise during cherry-picking or if a backport needs to be re-created, the branch maintainer may contact the original author to resolve these issues (ie. the original author will resolve the conflicts or re-create a path for an older release branch).

Once the release preparation PR is merged into the release branch, the branch maintainer will release the packages to the npm registry.
